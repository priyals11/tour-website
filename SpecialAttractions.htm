                <p class="center">One of the largest manmade lakes of Hyderabad, it connects the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. Hussain Sagar was constructed on a tributary of the Musi River by an engineer Hussain Shah Wahi during Ibrahim Quli Qutub Shah’s reign in 1562. It is a sprawling and expansive artificial lake, which holds water perennially. The lake also has a charming promenade that doubles up a busy thoroughfare today. Boating and Water Sports is a regular feature of Hussain Sagar Lake.</p>

                <p class="center">The Charminar is as much the signature of Hyderabad as the Taj Mahal is of Agra or the Eiffel Tower is of Paris. Mohammed Quli Qutab Shah, the founder of Hyderabad, built Charminar in 1591 at the centre of the original city layout. It is said to be built as a charm to ward off a deadly epidemic raging at that time. Four graceful minarets soar to a height of 48.7 m above the ground. Charminar has 45 prayer spaces and a mosque in it. Visitors can view the architectural splendour inside the Charminar. The monument is illuminated in the evenings and a pedestrianisation project around the monument is under implementation.</p>
